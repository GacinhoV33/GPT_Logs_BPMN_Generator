BPMN diagram describes library lending process.
First, the individual interested in borrowing a book must locate the desired item within the library's collection. This can be done by browsing the shelves, consulting the catalog, or asking a librarian for assistance. Once the book has been found, the borrower takes it to the circulation desk. At the desk, there is usually a librarian or library staff member who handles the borrowing process. The borrower presents their library card or identification to confirm their membership or eligibility to borrow materials. The librarian scans the barcode or manually enters the book's identification number into the library's system. This process records the transaction and updates the book's status as \"checked out\" in the library's database. The borrower may be asked to confirm their contact information or provide additional details if necessary. After the book has been checked out, the librarian deactivates the security measures in place, such as removing any electronic tags or desensitizing the book's barcode. This step ensures that the library's security system doesn't trigger any alarms when the borrower exits the premises. The borrower receives the book back and can take it home. Libraries usually set a due date for the return of borrowed materials. This due date is typically indicated on a receipt or a slip that the borrower receives at the circulation desk. It's essential for borrowers to adhere to this date to avoid overdue fines or penalties. When the borrower finishes reading the book or no longer needs it, they return it to the library. This can be done by bringing it to the circulation desk or placing it in a designated book drop-off location. The librarian scans the book's barcode, updates the library's system, and returns the book to its proper place on the shelves for other patrons to access. The library's system automatically updates the book's status from \"checked out\" to \"available\" once it has been returned successfully. This process ensures the book is ready for the next person who wants to borrow it.
